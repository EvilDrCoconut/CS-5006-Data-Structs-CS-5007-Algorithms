Assignment 1 Exercises

In order to start thinking a bit algorithmically, modify this file and answer the following questions. Be sure to add/commit/push any changes made to this file to our repository.


1.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses could it take to get the right number if we had no hint at all? Explain.

It could take 10 tries to get the right answer. It must be assumed that a user could possibly guess every incorrect answer before coming to the actual right answer.


2.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses does it take to get the right number if we get a hint of 'higher or lower' when guessing numbers 1-10? *Hint* In your answer you might show this mathematically with the log function.

With a hint given for each guess, and assuming a user follows the hints, then the guesses would become a binary search. Equivalent to a log n algorithm. So, given a random guess, it would be log2(10) which is roughly 3.32 guess on average by users.
