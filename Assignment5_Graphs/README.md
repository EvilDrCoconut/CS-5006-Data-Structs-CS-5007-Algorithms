While it was suggested to use a DLL, the slides seemed to use a SLL, and felt I had too little knowledge in BFS to adequetly use the SLL and Queue methods. Was unsure how dequeue worked as we were popping nodes and not just integers. Would take more time to better explain BFS or align the assingment more with slides suggestion for BFS.
